Quick custom fact howto

fact is basic script that provides info about a system - usually ruby 
fact is referred to as a resolution in more strict parlance - the fact is the output of the resolution

-> a call to facter.add - introduces new fact
-> zero or more confine statements - determines if resolution is suitable (e.g. tests what os first)
-> optional has_weight statement - if mutiple resolutions are available for a fact re evalled from highest to lowest
-> setcode statement that determines the value of a fact

usually place custom fact in $moduledir/lib/facts
can test on command line:

export FACTERLIB=/etc/puppet/modules/shizzle/lib/facter:$FACTERLIB

in /etc/puppet/modules/shizzle/lib/facter I've placed my sample fact about.rb:

require 'facter'
Facter.add(:about) do
  setcode do
    Facter::Util::Resolution.exec("cat /etc/about")
  end
end


this just gives info about the nodes use:

> facter about
mongodb server
